the aim of the WINDOWS folder is just a mean for the author 
to test compilation on the WINDOWS platform using MINGW64 ...


## Compile
run a mingw terminal session
just lanch mingw-make in the windows directory

## Use

dspcreate can be used to locally generate .bin files for a given target platform (like xmos)
