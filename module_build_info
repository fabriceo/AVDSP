# This file describes how this module will affect the application
# using it. The file is included in the Makefile of the main application.
#
# The module contributes to the build of the application by extending 
# the following variables:
#
#   SOURCE_DIRS  - directories with source files to be included in the build
#   INCLUDE_DIRS - directories to be added to the include path during the build 
#   LIB_DIRS     - directories containing libraries to be linked into the build
#
# Note that all the source files in each directory in SOURCE_DIRS 
# will be compiled (you do not need to name the files individually).
# 

MODULE_DIRS = #module_avdsp/runtime	# compiles only the files in the runtime folder

SOURCE_DIRS  += $(MODULE_DIRS)
INCLUDE_DIRS += $(MODULE_DIRS)
EXCLUDE_FILES += 

# You can change the flags of a set of files using the SET_XCC_[lang]_FLAGS
# functions. The first argument is a list of directories and the
# second argument is the value to set the compile flags to. e.g.
#
# $(call SET_XCC_C_FLAGS, mydir1 mydir2, $(XCC_FLAGS) -g -O3)

#$(call SET_XCC_C_FLAGS, $(MODULE_DIRS) $(XCC_FLAGS) -g -O3)
#$(call SET_XCC_XC_FLAGS, $(MODULE_DIRS), $(XCC_FLAGS) -g -O3)

# You can change the flags of an individual file by setting the 
# XCC_FLAGS_[filename] variable. e.g.
#
# XCC_FLAGS_myfile.xc = $(XCC_FLAGS) -fsubword-select


# You can exclude particular files from the build even if they occur
# within SOURCE_DIRS by adding the file name (with no path) to the 
# EXCLUDE_FILES variable e..g
#
# EXCLUDE_FILES += myfile.xc
#
